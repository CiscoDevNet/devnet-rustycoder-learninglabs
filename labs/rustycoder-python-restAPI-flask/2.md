## Step 3. Create a REST API service for your python program using Flask.

It's also useful to expose your python program through REST APIs. This can be done easily using Flask. We have some sample code to get you started in a file called ``rest-api.py``. You downloaded it earlier.

* `cd /Users/username/Code/devnet-rustycoder-samplecode`

First, let's create a more interesting web server/web service.
Let's look at the code.

The first part imports the Flask library and creates the app instance, but this time we will import some useful functions that will help us with our REST calls.
```
# import functions from the flask library
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request, abort

# create an app instance
app = Flask(__name__)
```

Nexst, we will create a new resource called `devices` which has an `id`, device name `name`, and device IP address `ip`.
```
# create a devices resource
devices = [
    {
        "id": 0,
        "name": "NX-9K-1",
        "ip": "10.0.0.1"
    },
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "NX-9K-2",
        "ip": "10.0.0.2"
    }
]
```

Next, we define the behavior of our program for the REST APIs. We are creating a REST API for `http://baseurl/api/devices/` with `GET` and `POST`. We will turn our response into JSON using `jsonify`.
```
# handle GET request
@app.route('/api/devices/', methods=['GET'])
def get_devices():
    return jsonify({'tasks': devices})

# handle POST request
@app.route('/api/devices/', methods=['POST'])
def post_device():
    #  check required parameters
    # if doesn't have all required parameters, return 404 error
    if not request.json or 'name' not in request.json or 'ip' not in request.json:
        abort(404)

    # generate device obj
    device = {
        "id": len(devices),
        "name": request.json['name'],
        "ip": request.json['ip']
    }

    # add device obj to devices resources
    devices.append(device)

    # return devices resources with 201 state code
    return jsonify({'task': devices}), 201
```

The last part runs the webserver with your REST API at the specified URL and port when the script is executed.
```
# main entry
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # run app when script is been execute
    # this will create a web server at port 8080, you can visit http://0.0.0.0:8080/
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True)
```

## Step 4. Now let's run it all.

This example will create a REST API to handle `GET` & `POST` request operation to *device* resource.

* `python3 rest-api.py` Run your program. The service will running at the url : `http://0.0.0.0:8080/api/devices/`

* Make a `GET` request to that API [http://0.0.0.0:8080/api/devices/](http://0.0.0.0:8080/api/devices/) using **Postman**
    ![Get Request](doc/images/img-1.png)

* Make a *POST* request using **Postman**
** Add `Content-Type : application/json` to header
![POST Request](doc/images/img-2.png)
** Add request body
```json
{
    "name":"NX-9K-1",
    "ip":"10.0.0.3"
}
```
![POST Request](doc/images/img-3.png)

* Send your request

![POST Request](doc/images/img-4.png)

Wow! You just created a REST API for your python program and called your APIs from Postman! You're not looking so rusty anymore! Congratulations!
