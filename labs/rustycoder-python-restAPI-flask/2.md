# Step 2. Make a web server/web service for your Python program using Flask.

Next, we will create a web server for your Python program. This involves creating a simple web server/service in your app and defining its behavior for incoming web requests.

We created some sample code to get you started. Let's go get it from GitHub.

* `cd /Users/username/Code` Go to your working directory.
* `git clone http://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-rustycoder-samplecode` Download the sample code from Cisco DevNet.
* `cd devnet-rustycoder-samplecode/python-flask-helloworld`
You will see a file called `web-server.py`. Let's take a closer look at what's inside.

The first part simply imports the Flask library and creates the app instance.
```
# import flask library
from flask import Flask

# create an app instance
app = Flask(__name__)
```
The next part defines the behavior of your program for web requests. We are defining two behaviors- one for when the user visits the base URL `http://baseurl/` and the other for when the user visits `http://baseurl/devnet`.

```
# define url router, this function will respond when a user visits "/"
@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    // Put your Python code here!
    return 'Hello, World!'

# define url router, this function will respond when a user visits "/devnet"
@app.route('/devnet')
def hello_devnet():
    // Put your Python code here!
    return 'Hello, DevNet!'
```
The last part runs the web server with your defined behavior when the script is executed. This is where you specify the URL and port.
```
# main entry
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # run app when the script is executed
    # this will create a web server at port 8080, you can visit http://0.0.0.0:8080/ and http://0.0.0.0:8080/devnet
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True)
```
Let's run this.
* `python3 web-server.py` Run this command
* Open a browser and go to `http://0.0.0.0:8080/` You should see "Hello, World!"
* Now go to `http://0.0.0.0:8080/devnet` You should see "Hello, DevNet!"
Congratulations! You just created a web service for your Python program! You served it through your simple web server running at port 8080. Exciting!

You can put all your Python code in here and create some really cool web services. Next, we need to RESTify it so that your program can respond to REST requests.

#### Next Step: Create a REST API service for your Python program using Flask.
