# Step 4. Run our new web service and call our new REST API with Postman

Now let's put it all together. In the last step we created a REST API to handle `GET` & `POST` request operation to *device* resource.
* `python3 rest-api.py` Run the program. The service will running at the url : `http://0.0.0.0:8080/api/devices/`
* Make a `GET` request to that API [http://0.0.0.0:8080/api/devices/](http://0.0.0.0:8080/api/devices/) using **Postman**

Next, we will make a **POST** request using **Postman** to add another device to the list
* Add `Content-Type : application/json` to the header

* Add the request body
```json
{
    "name":"NX-9K-1",
    "ip":"10.0.0.3"
}
```

* Send your request

Wow! You just created a REST API for your Python program and called your APIs from Postman!

#### Next Step: Call a REST API from your Python program using requests
