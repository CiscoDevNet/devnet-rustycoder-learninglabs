# Step 4: Get going with Postman

As a rusty coder, you know what an API is. But today all the rage is about REST APIs. You can find various tutorials about REST APIs on the web and on DevNet, but here we will just quickly get you set up with a very useful tool for making REST API calls called **Postman**.

First, download and install **Postman**.
* Go to [getpostman.com](http://getpostman.com) to download Postman.
* Install Postman on your computer.

Postman has a request builder that helps you build and make HTTP requests and see the responses.

## Learn more about Postman

Postman is a very useful tool that goes well beyond what is discussed here. You can learn more by looking at the [Postman docs](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/).

### Congratulations! You've Completed Hello World for Rusty Coders!
