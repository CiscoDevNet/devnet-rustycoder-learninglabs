# HelloWorld for the Rusty Coder: Get started (for Mac)

This DevNet Learning Lab helps a "rusty" coder quickly download modern software tools and use them to write a Hello World app. It is not a comprehensive tutorial about the tools, as there are many free resources out there today. Rather, it is a way to quickly get set up, get hands on, and get working code. We made some choices for you to minimize the research you need to do to get coding. We assume that you will dig deeper after you're done to learn more.

A rusty coder is someone who coded in their past (say, over 5, 10, or 20 years ago) and wants to get started again using the tools that are available today in a fast easy way. A rusty coder probably used Unix or Windows in the past. A rusty coder has used a command line and coded with APIs in an older operating system and language, but may not have coded with REST APIs. This learning lab is designed for developing on a Mac today.

## Objectives

The objective of this lab is to show the rusty coder how to:

* Find and use the Terminal and command line tools on their Mac.
* Install and use the latest version of Python.
* Install and use Git and GitHub for storing and sharing code.
* Install postman for making REST API calls.

If you already know how to use the Mac Terminal, Python, Git, and GitHub, then you should skip this learning lab.

## Prerequisites

You need a Mac with an Internet connection.

## Step 1: Find the Terminal on your Mac and play around in Unix

The Mac is a developer's machine and the **Terminal** has lots of stuff built in for developers. Mac OS uses OS X which is built on Unix, so a rusty coder can get going quickly.

Let's open up your Terminal and pin it to your dock, since you will be doing lots of coding.

1. Open up your **Finder**. Click **Applications**. Open the **Utilities folder**. Double-click **Terminal** to open it.
   Or, a faster way to bring up the **Terminal** from your keyboard is to press **command-spacebar** and type **Terminal**.
1. Pin it to your dock by dragging the Terminal icon to the Dock.

Now play around in the Terminal.
* `pwd` shows you what directory you're in. Hey look, you have a **/Users/username** folder, also known as a home directory!
* `ls` shows what's in your current directory, which should be your home directory. You will find your **Documents**, **Downloads**, **Desktop**, and other familiar folders.
* `mkdir Code` Go ahead and create a folder for you to code in right there at the top level. You can do your coding in **/Users/username/Code**.
* `emacs` or `vi` Use your favorite old school text editor.
* `ls /usr/bin` Take a look at all the commands that are available at your finger tips.

Yes, it's all there. Is it all coming back to you now?

Now let's get some software tools installed on your machine.
