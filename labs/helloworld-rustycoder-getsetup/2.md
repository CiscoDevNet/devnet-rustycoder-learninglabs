# Step 2: Get started with Python

Python is one of the fastest-growing programming languages. If you want to learn one language, I would recommend you start there. Some version of Python is already installed on your Mac, but go ahead and download the latest from python.org.

1. Go to [python.org](http://python.org) to download the latest version of Python.
1. Install Python.
   When finished, your command to run Python in Terminal is **python3**.
1. Close your Terminal and open a new one so it can find your new python3 executable.
1. Type `python3` at your command line. You now have an execution environment for Python, known as the interpreter.
1. In the interpreter, type:
   ```
   >>> print("Hello World")
   ```
1. To exit the interpreter, type:
   ```
   >>> quit()
   ```

Congratulations! You just wrote your first Hello World command in Python and managed to exit the interpreter!

Now let's write and run a Python script.
1. In the Terminal window, go to your new Code directory by typing:
   ```
   cd /Users/username/Code
   ```
1. Use your favorite text editor to create a file called **hellodevnet.py**:
   ```emacs hellodevnet.py
   ```
1. Put the following text in your new file:
   ```
   print("Hello World")
   print("Hello DevNet")
   ```
1. Type **ctrl-x ctrl-s** to save and exit.
1. In the Terminal window, run the Python script you just saved:
   ```
   python3 hellodevnet.py
   ```

Congratulations! You just ran your first Hello World Python program!
